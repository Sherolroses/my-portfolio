    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a dental assistant at Dental and Ortho while studying a Bachelor of Computer Science in Computing at the University of South Africa. I am passionate about creating useful tools and building websites that solve real-life problems.
      While learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and Python, I'm constantly seeking to expand my skills through hands-on projects. I believe in using my technical knowledge to improve efficiency, simplify processes, and make a positive difference in people's lives.
      My goal is to continue learning, developing my skills, and contributing to projects that have a meaningful impact in the world. I aspire to have my own company and pursue a PhD to further my knowledge and expertise in technology and innovation.
      I am driven to not only make a difference in my field but also to create opportunities for others and continue growing both professionally and academically.
